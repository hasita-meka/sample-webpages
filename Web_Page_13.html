    <h1>Some common block tags</h1>
    <h2>hr</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;hr&gt; element used to stand for "horizontal line" and that is still how it is typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning,"semantic break". I will be using it often to break up example files when I want
        to display multiple tages in one file
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>address</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;address&gt; element indicates that the text is an address specific to the page,perhaps contact information for the author.
    </p>
    <address>1715 Walnut Blvd<br />Ashtabula OH 44004</address>
    <hr />
    <h2>blockquote</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;blockquote&gt; element is used for extended quotations. It should include the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.

    <hr />
    <h2>details</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;details&gt; element is used in conjunction with the &lt;summary&gt;. It is one of the tags that was creaated in response to the repeated use of scripting to open and close content. It is not supported by all the browsers yet though.
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>The summary</summary>
        The rest of the details content goes here. If only &lt;details&gt; is not supported, then the summary and the content are always visible.
    </details>
