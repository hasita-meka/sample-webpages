    <h1>Inline elements</h1>
    <p>
        Why do we bother with inline elements? There are certainly times we want to mark up content, but we don't want to insert the line breaks around them.The &lt;span&gt; tag was the first to give you that ability, but it was mostly used to style the code,
        and we don't want to do that. Some of the newer tags that still separate content and style are listed below.
    </p>
    <h1>Citing a source-cite</h1>
    <p>
        The &lt;cite&gt; makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for this specific information.
    </p>
    <p>
        A great reference for these and other elements is
        <cite><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
					>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML</a
				></cite

		<h2>Defining your abbreviations-abbr</h2>
		<p>
			The &lt;abbr&gt; will display an abbreviation on the browser. But if a
			title attribute is specified in the tag, the title will appear when the
			house hovers over the abbreviation. Screen readers alsoprovide the title
			information.
		</p>
		<p>
			The days of the week are often abbreviated:<abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr
			>, <abbr title="Monday">Mon</abbr>, <abbr title="Tuesday">Tues</abbr>,etc.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Specifying the use of time-time</h2>
		<p>
			The &lt;time&gt; is again a completely semantic tag that can be used to
			search for specific information.
		</p>
		<p>The party starts at <time>9:00pm</time>.</p>
		<p>The party took place on New Year's Eve.</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Identifying code fragments-code</h2>
		<p>
			The &lt;code&gt; element tends to be displayed in a different font, but
			also has the semantic meaning to convey information to as many people as
			possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have been trying to learn how to write html but my
			<code>img</code> elements never seem to work
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2>Using subscripts and superscripts-sub and sup</h2>
		<p>
			The &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; elements are used to create super and
			subscripts. e.g.(x+y)<sup>3</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O. In the past, people
			would often paste mathematical images into the page. But mages didn't
			convey the same meaning to all users.
